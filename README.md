# BlockBreaker
A recreation of classic block breaking games like Arkanoid. A paddel at the bottom of the screen is used
to bounce a ball that hits blocks above the paddel, these blocks disappear after one or more hits, there are three types
blocks whom each have different color. The game contains background music, sound effects for the ball bouncing and for the 
blocks breaking. Just like the classic block breaking games once all destructible blocks on the level are gone the player
will be moved onto a new level without interruption of the background music.
